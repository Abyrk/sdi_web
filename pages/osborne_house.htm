  <h2><strong>Osborne House,</strong> York Avenue, East Cowes, Isle of Wight - PO32 6JX</h2>

  <p><img class="imgleft" src="../images/osborne_house2.jpg" alt="box" />Osborne House was Queen Victoria's summer residence. 
  Queen Victoria and Prince Albert bought the Osborne estate on the Isle of Wight in 1845. 
  There they created a private home away from court life in London and Windsor. 
  Queen Victoria used Osborne for more than 50 years, entertaining foreign royalty and 
  visiting ministers as well as her own extensive family, and after Prince Albert's 
  death in 1861 she found solace there. Many of the rooms are still filled with 
  original furniture and works of art, reflecting the couple's personal tastes, 
  while the planting in the grounds is to Prince Albert's designs. </p>
  
  <p>Not much is known of the site's earliest history. In 1705 the Blachford famile took over the estate. From 1774 to 1781 
  Robert Pope Blachford (1742-90) extended and adapted an existing house into a three-storey residence, 
  with a walled kitchen garden and a brick stable block.
